# "All Haskell Number Types"

In some languages there is a notion of a "numeric tower." The reasoning behind
this is: there is an obvious way to inject less precise numbers into a more
precise number type. While this makes sense mathematically, this doesn't
even strictly work for the humble Int and Double types[1]!

Haskell has more of a "numeric salad bowl" of number types. Each kind of
number has different strengths and drawbacks. Which one you want to use depends
on factors like

- convenience: The standard library uses Int in many places.
- performance: Is numeric code your programs bottleneck? Double and Int compute
faster due to hardware support. They can also take up less memory.
- faithfulness: Double can't represent an arbitrary rational number. But Rational can.
- security: Allowing users to specify arbitrary Integers or Rationals can be
a denial of service vulnerability.
- safety: Natural will crash on some subtractions while Integer won't.

This is a list of the most common number types and what to import to get them.
